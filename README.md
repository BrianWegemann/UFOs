# Surfs Up-Analysis 
Module 11 Challenge

Overview of the Project
Purpose: 
The purpose of this analysis is to create a website centered around UFO sightings from around the world. Using JavaScript and HTML, we’ve created a website that allows users to view UFO sighting data, and to filter that information by date, city, state, county, and even the shape of the UFO that was spotted.

Results
Findings
The website we have created allows users to filter the data by date, city, state, county, and shape. These filters can be applied individually or all together. In the image below, we filtered the data to look for sightings in El Cajon, CA on January 4, 2010. These filters returned one result, a sighting of “fake stars” over San Diego. Users can apply these filters as they wish and the table will automatically update to reflect the applied filters. 

 
If desired, users can filter just by object shape. For example, if we input “circle” into the shape filter, the table updates to look like this:
 
Summary
Drawbacks
One drawback of the webpage is that the data cannot be displayed in any other format than a table. Although the table is great for finding specific sighting, there is no way for the user to generate a quick count of sightings in a particular country or city, they cannot see where these locations are on the map, and no charts can be created to show which locations or time ranges have the most sightings of UFO’s
Further Development
There are many ways to flush out this webpage. Two recommendations I have to make this webpage really stand out are to include a map view that will plot sightings based on their location, and to incorporate tools for displaying the data in charts for quick counts and comparisons.
